Dear {} Management,

Our records indicate that we have not received maintenance records for the {} at {}. Our pretreatment code requires customers with these devices to maintain them at a minimum of every three months and report all maintenance to the District. For the complete code, please visit: Mukilteowwd.org. We will be conducting on-site inspections in the very near future.  Businesses that we do not have current maintenance records for will be our first priority. You can email your records to: Brandonh@mukilteowwd.org or return them to 7824 Mukilteo Speedway Mukilteo WA 98275 C\O Brandon Henson.  If you need a log form, you can contact me and I will provide one. Otherwise, the log shall include Date, Time, Amount Pumped, hauler, and Disposal Site.


I look forward to working with you.

Thank you for your time,
